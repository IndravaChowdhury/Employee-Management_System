This project is assigned to me for developing a Employee Management System with the help of basic C programming language. The aim of the project is to create a program that will supervise and manage all the employees of a particular company. I have used basic data handling technique for the execution of this project. Here, we can add the name of the employee, his age and his basic salary. We can further modify the record by adding or deleting from the database.
